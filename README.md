Simple [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/) Java client

# What is provided

Support for basic INSTREAM scanning and PING command. 

Clamd protocol is explained here:
http://linux.die.net/man/8/clamd

# Using the client

Code is self explanatory. Something like this is the idea:

```
ClamAVClient cl = new ClamAVClient("192.168.50.72", 3310);
byte[] reply = cl.scan(input);
if (!ClamAVClient.isCleanReply(reply)) throw new Exception("aaargh");
```

# Creating the jar

```
mvn install
```

# Testing the client

To run the automated tests you are assumed to run the clamd in a local virtual machine. 
Configuration for [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [https://www.virtualbox.org/](Oracle Virtualbox) is provided. 

To start test server simply

```
cd vagrant
vagrant up clamav
```

This will kick up a CentOS virtual machine and install [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/) in it.
